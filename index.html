			<p>This page was created in the process of undergoing an online course of Web Development conducted by Coursera, titled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers">HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers.</a> Included in this site are the assignments I created throughout this course, as follows:</p>

			<ul id="assignment-list">
				<li><h4><a href="https://chrisraynaldo.github.io/coursera-test/mod2-solution" target="_blank">&gt; Module 2 Assignment</a></h4><p>Our first assignment that was given the second week of the course. The main focus of the assignment is to familiarise ourselves with the responsive design using the grid system and media queries to detect screen size. In this module, we are NOT supposed to use the Twitter Bootstrap, yet.</p></li>

				<li><h4><a href="https://chrisraynaldo.github.io/coursera-test/mod3-solution/" target="_blank">&gt; Module 3 Assignment</a></h4><p>Our second assignment asks us to use the Twitter Bootstrap to create a menu button that appears on the (usually) top right of the page when a user browse the page on mobile (the hamburger menu, if you will). The assignment doesn't emphasise on respnosive design, hence why you would see my site is just a boring one-on-top-the-other kind of list.</p></li>

				<li><h4><a href="https://chrisraynaldo.github.io/coursera-test/mod4-solution/harder/" target="_blank">&gt; Module 4 Assignment</a></h4><p>The fourth assignment is a bit different from what we had seen, since all of the assignments are in the Javascript section of the page. Hence, in order to see anything, you would need to "Inspect" the page when using a Chrome browser to see the console log, as well as the Javascript file that is causing the logs to be printed in the console.</p></li>

				<li><h4><a href="https://chrisraynaldo.github.io/coursera-test/mod5-solution/" target="_blank">&gt; Module 5 Assignment</a></h4><p>The last assignment after 5 weeks of learning front-end web development! Though it may look like a lot, most of the code have been prepared by the kind lecturer. Since most of our job is to edit a couple of lines of code here and there in order to allow the website to load <em>dynamically</em>.</p></li>
